# My First Project – Basic Page Structure

This is my first web design project, created as part of my Web Design class. It shows a basic webpage structure using HTML and CSS.

##  About the Project

This project includes a simple webpage layout. It is built using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. I used:

- `float` to arrange boxes side by side
- `line-height` to center text vertically
- `box-sizing: border-box` to make layout easier and cleaner

##  What This Page Has

- Header, main content, and footer sections
- Proper HTML tags (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Styling with CSS
- No Flexbox or Grid – only float

##  What I Learned

- How to make a basic web page using HTML and CSS
- How to use float to position elements
- How to center text using line-height
- How box-sizing affects layout and spacing

##  How to Open the Project

1. Download the project folder
2. Open the folder on your computer
3. Double-click the `index.html` file
4. It will open in your browser
